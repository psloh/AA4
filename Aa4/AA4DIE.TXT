You have died.  With no more ships to lead Earth's defense,
the evil Plutonians converge upon the Earth.  Their newly
developed death ray wipes out the planet.  With this increase
in momentum, they sweep through the galaxy, destroying all
human life.

Your loss has betrayed the human race.


Some pilot you are.
